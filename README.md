<h1>Field-Day<h/1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Field Day is a casual multiplayer game where one person plays as an ant and another person plays as a human. The setting takes place on a picnic blanket. On the picnic blanket there will be two of five different foods (donuts, chicken, chicken nuggets, fries, sandwiches and other), as well as rocks. If you collect the food you gain 10 points, if you bump into the rocks you lose one point. Every time a peice of food is collected it will regenerate so you can continue to collect food until the game is over (2 minutes). Whoever has the highest score in the end wins! In addition, on the start up screen there is an animation of food- but there is only one for two of you. Whoever collects it first gets 10 bonus points.
